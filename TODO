This is a toplevel overview TODO-file. Please see lib/TODO for lots of details.

code ripeness TODO:
- thorough testing with non-GSM packets
- refactoring in a few places where it's rough
- testing of installation
- more unit-tests
- good documentation of usage and scientific background

feature wishlist:
- deconvolution with noise-autocorrelation-matrix for coloured noise
- channel-estimate with sample-rate for better matched-filtering
    (this needs coloured noise handling to be useful)
- provide hints on what exactly to do around this module: how much syncronisation is needed, what input filtering is best, and so on.
- perhaps switchable metric between euclidean and coloured-noise


BUGS
immernoch: braucht touch lib/Makefile.gen
