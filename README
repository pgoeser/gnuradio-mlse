This directory (and the resulting tarball) contains a build tree for
an MLSE-deconvolution-block for gnuradio, and associated components
and helpers.

This package requires that gnuradio-core is already installed.  It
also depends on some GNU Radio prerequisites, such as Boost, cppunit
and SWIG. 

To build the examples from the tarball use the normal recipe:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check

If you're building from git, you'll need to use this sequence, since
git doesn't contain configure or the generated Makefiles.

  $ ./bootstrap
  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check


There is a bug in the build-system with lib/Makefile.gen. When something
does not work, you need to either rm, touch or make that file, then it should work. Furthermore, it might still require autoconf < 2.68.

The code is still in need of cleanup. The test-app can be run with python/run_testapp, 
which takes a parameter on which test to run, see python/testapp.py


This package includes the following blocks (all written in C++):

Deconvolution:
    mlse_equalizer_midamble_vcb wraps everything to provide deconvolution
    mlse_viterbi_vcb            the viterbi algorithm doing the deconvolution
    mlse_channelestimate_vcc    channel-estimator necessary for it
Necessary building blocks for deconvolution:
    mlse_vector_slice_vv        slices a subset out of a vector
    mlse_vector_concat_vv       appends two vectors
    mlse_lut_bXv                implements a lookup table, which outputs a vector in 
                                response to an index

Useful blocks, used for testing or building apps using MLSE:
    mlse_randint_X              random int source, using a mersenne twister
                                (can be approximated with noise and type conversion)
    mlse_packetbuilder_midamble_vbb  build matching bursts that can be received with 
                                     mlse_equalizer_midamble_vcb
    mlse_derotate_cc            derotate a signal like gsm

non-block classes:
    packet_config               contains the configuration parameters of a burst system,
                                necessary for packetbuilder and equalizer_midamble
    packet_config_gsm           packet_config for gsm
    mlse_viterbi_impl           implementation for mlse_viterbi_vcb
    channel_model               internal class of mlse_viterbi_impl
    

The package also includes a small testapp that can produce biterror-rate-plots, and
a few python-blocks for it.
